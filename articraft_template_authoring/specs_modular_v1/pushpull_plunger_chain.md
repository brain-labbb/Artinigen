# Modular Spec: pushpull_plunger_chain

## 1. Core Identity

- Category slug: `pushpull_plunger_chain`
- Dataset path: `data`
- 5-star sample audit: 38 complete 5-star records were read for `model.py`, `revision.json`, `record.json`, prompt, and metadata. The category has enough 5-star samples to proceed.
- Core identity: a grounded guide, frame, or sleeve constrains one or more coaxial plunger rods with PRISMATIC translation along the push-pull axis. Many samples add a carried terminal clevis, hinged tab, or lever output so the sliding rod exposes useful end actuation instead of being a bare block.
- Required articulation identity: at least one PRISMATIC joint along the main plunger axis; optional additional PRISMATIC stages in series and optional REVOLUTE output flap/lever.
- Non-identity variation: paint, material color, decorative bolt count, and small scale-only changes are not valid module candidates.

## 4. Interface Points

- `support.slide_axis`: +X line through the guide/sleeve center; provides `parent_axis=(1,0,0)` and `MotionLimits(lower=0, upper=stroke)`.
- `support.front_face`: fixed or near-fixed guide exit where terminal outputs must sit ahead of the housing.
- `plunger.upstream_axis`: child origin on the rod centerline; consumes the support slide interface.
- `plunger.downstream_axis`: optional serial PRISMATIC interface for secondary rods; same +X axis.
- `plunger.terminal_mount`: fixed clevis/pad or REVOLUTE hinge point, usually near the front end of the last rod.
- `lever_or_tab.pivot`: Y-axis REVOLUTE hinge, separated from the slide axis enough to avoid current-pose overlap.

## 5. Multiplicity / Copy Logic

- `stage_count=1`: support + primary plunger + optional hinged tab/lever.
- `stage_count=2`: support + primary plunger + secondary plunger + fixed clevis or pad.
- `stage_count=3`: support + three carried/nested plunger sections; terminal clevis required.
- Repeated PRISMATIC stages copy the +X axis, decreasing rod radius/width and decreasing stroke from rear to front.
- Terminal outputs are not repeated. A hinged tab or lever may appear only once on the guide/rod nose; a terminal clevis appears only on the final stage.

## 6. Compatibility Matrix

| Combination | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| compact_bridge_guide + rectangular_rod_with_button + hinged_tab | allowed | Source-backed single-slider with front tab. |
| fork_sleeve_frame + round_stepped_rod + fork_lever | allowed | Source-backed sleeve plus independent lever/cam. |
| rail_bed_sleeve + carried_sleeve_plunger + triple_telescoping_stage + terminal_clevis | allowed | Source-backed carried sleeve cascade. |
| bored_base_stack + stepped_ejector_section + telescoping_second_stage + terminal_clevis | allowed | Source-backed coaxial nested ejector stack. |
| open_channel + rectangular rod + hinged_tab | allowed | Open rail block and rod-carried flap are both 5-star structures. |
| hinged_tab with triple_telescoping_stage | reject | Samples with multi-stage plungers use clevis/pad outputs; a hinged flap would collide or misrepresent the long coaxial stack. |
| fork_lever with stage_count > 1 | reject | Fork lever samples are single plunger plus lever/cam, not telescoping rods. |
| PRISMATIC axis not +X | reject | All cited 5-star push-pull mechanisms translate along the rod axis. |

## 7. Topology Diversity Audit

- Support topology varies between compact bridge, fork sleeve frame, long rail bed, open U-channel, and bored base/guide stack.
- Moving topology varies between single rectangular rod, round stepped rod, carried-sleeve rod, two-stage telescoping rod, and three-stage cascade.
- Output topology varies between no separate moving output, REVOLUTE flap/tab, independent REVOLUTE lever, and fixed terminal clevis.
- Joint topology must cover `1P+1R`, `1P`, `2P+F`, and `3P+F` families across sweep seeds.

## 8. Procedural Sampling / Sweep Plan

- `config_from_seed(seed)` uses `random.Random(seed)`; seed 0 is not special.
- Sample implemented topology family first, then sample compatible modules within that family. Do not use a modulo table or sample modules not built/tested.
- Sweep seeds must cover support family, stage count, plunger profile, terminal output, stroke length, rod radius/width, and frame spacing.
- Expected sweep gates: seed0, fast, medium, final 50 seeds with `module_topology_diversity` distinct slot choices.

## 9. Controlled Local Parameterization

- Stroke range: `0.035-0.18` m, decreasing for later telescoping stages.
- Rod radius/half-width: controlled per profile; secondary rods are smaller than upstream rods.
- Guide clearance: visual sleeves/rails must sit around, not deeply intersect, current-pose moving rods unless explicitly allowed by tests.
- Terminal hinge limits: flap/lever lower/upper bounds remain small enough to preserve closed-pose identity.
- Support length scales with stage count so terminal clevis remains ahead of guide front.

## 10. Validator

- Must contain at least one PRISMATIC articulation with axis `(1, 0, 0)`.
- Stage count must match the selected topology family.
- For flap/lever families, must contain a REVOLUTE joint with Y-axis hinge.
- For telescoping families, all serial PRISMATIC joints must be coaxial and ordered parent-to-child.
- Terminal output must be on the final moving stage or a source-backed guide pivot.
- Current pose must have one root, no disconnected geometry islands, and no unapproved 3D overlaps.

## 11. Reject Cases

- A plain decorative cylinder sliding without a guide/frame.
- Color/material-only candidate changes.
- A revolute-only lever without any push-pull PRISMATIC plunger.
- Telescoping rods sampled with a flap/lever terminal that was not implemented/tested.
- Non-coaxial PRISMATIC axes or mixed random axes.
- Replacing source-backed sleeve/rail/clevis complexity with a single anonymous box when the module claims that source candidate.
