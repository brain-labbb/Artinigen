# Modular Template Spec: multisegment_foldout_arm

## Review Header

- dataset_path: `data`
- mode: `SPEC_ONLY`
- reviewer_status: `approved`
- five_star_sample_count: 33
- required_files_read: `model.py`, `revision.json`, `record.json`, `prompt.txt`, `collections/dataset.json`
- template_scope: fold-out articulated arms with three or more serial segments, visible hinges, and a terminal carried by the final segment.

## Core Identity

A valid `multisegment_foldout_arm` is a compact arm that unfolds through a serial chain of revolute hinge stations. It must include a grounded base or bracket, multiple arm segments that nest or fold over one another, and a terminal module at the end. The category identity is the deployable multi-segment fold-out topology: repeated hinged links, stowed/deployed motion, and visible pivot hardware.

Required invariants:

- A grounded base supports the first hinge.
- At least three moving serial fold-out segments or two moving segments plus a functional terminal bracket; richer samples use four or five moving serial elements.
- Main fold-out joints are revolute.
- Hinges must be visible as eyes, clevises, barrels, side plates, pins, bushings, or trunnions.
- A deployed pose extends the terminal away from the base.
- A folded pose must remain coherent and not erase the arm identity.

## Interface Points

| Interface | Required frame | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base.root_pivot` | Origin at first hinge; +X initial deployment direction; axis from `axis_family` | Base must include clevis/eye/pin geometry surrounding root pivot. |
| `segment.in` | Local root hinge center | Accepts previous segment's distal eye/trunnion/fork. |
| `segment.out` | Local distal hinge center, usually `(length,0,offset_z)` | Required on every non-terminal segment. |
| `terminal.in` | Local hinge center at final link | Must mate to last segment out and move with final revolute. |
| `aux.base_pivot` | Base-local pivot for latch/toggle | Optional; must not replace main fold-out chain. |

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic

- `segment_count` samples 3-5 for the main serial arm. Terminal module is separate when it is a tray/fork/pad; a plain tip link may count as the final moving segment.
- Each segment copy receives a generated local length, width, hinge radius, and distal offset while preserving the selected profile's part tree.
- Distal joint origin of segment `i` becomes the parent frame for segment `i+1`.
- Auxiliary latch/toggle modules may add 0-2 extra revolute joints plus fixed covers, but these are not counted as main segment multiplicity.
- Segment names must be indexed and stable: `segment_0`, `segment_1`, ..., `terminal`, with auxiliary names distinct.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Combination | offset foot | nested yoke | sideplate pawl base | flat frame | offset eye links | paired side plates | slotted keeper | tray | fork | aux latch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parallel_pitch_foldout` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | limited |
| `parallel_pin_sideplate_chain` | limited | yes | yes | limited | limited | yes | yes | yes | limited | no |
| `auxiliary_fold_lock_pitch` | no | limited | limited | yes | no | limited | yes | no | yes | yes |
| `tray_end_bracket` | limited | yes | yes | no | limited | yes | limited | yes | no | no |
| `end_fork` | limited | limited | no | yes | limited | limited | yes | no | yes | yes |

Rules:

- `toggle_and_latch_pair` requires a base with explicit aux pivots and enough side clearance.
- `slotted_keeper_link` requires CADQuery side-plate implementation; do not degrade to a plain box.
- Tray modules require the final hinge to remain level enough that the tray reads as carried payload support.
- Mixed axis families must preserve mating orientation; unsupported mixed pitch/yaw combinations must be rejected before build.

## Topology Diversity Audit

Covered topology:

- Bases: offset foot, nested yoke, sideplate pawl base, flat frame with aux pivots.
- Main segment count: 3, 4, 5.
- Link topology: offset eye plate, paired side plates, lightened sculpted CADQuery plates, slotted keeper links.
- Hinge topology: eye-hole pin, lobe pin caps, ring/trunnion side plates.
- Terminal topology: plain tip, tray, compact tray, end fork.
- Auxiliary topology: none, fixed cover, toggle/latch revolutes.

Non-topological variation:

- Colors/materials alone.
- Uniform scaling of the same link graph.
- Decorative bolt heads without hinge, base, or terminal interface function.

## Procedural Sampling / Sweep Plan

Sampling must use deterministic `random.Random(seed)` and must not special-case `seed=0`.

1. Sample `segment_count` from 3-5.
2. Sample base and axis family.
3. Sample segment profile compatible with base and axis family.
4. Generate a decreasing or alternating length sequence, with optional `dz` offsets.
5. Sample hinge interface and terminal module compatible with segment profile.
6. Sample auxiliary fold-lock only if base supports aux pivots.
7. Sample controlled parameters after topology: reach, first segment ratio, width, height, hinge clearance, joint limits.
8. Reject unsupported module combinations before model construction.

Sweep:

- Run `uv run articraft template sweep-pipeline multisegment_foldout_arm`.
- Require threshold pass across 50 seeds and module topology diversity pass.
- Inspect representative seeds for stowed/deployed identity and terminal visibility.

## Controlled Local Parameterization

Allowed ranges:

- `reach`: 0.54-1.34 m.
- `segment_count`: 3-5.
- `link_width`: 0.036-0.078 m.
- `link_height`: at least 0.032 m and proportional to width.
- `hinge_clearance`: 0.0035-0.012 m.
- `first_segment_ratio`: 0.82-1.26.
- Joint limits: sampled by scale 0.72-1.28 while preserving fold-out deployment.
- Segment lengths may taper by about 0.8-0.95 per segment, but the final terminal must remain functional and visible.

Parameterization cannot remove side plates, slots, eyes, trunnions, tray lips, or auxiliary latch geometry when those modules are selected.

## Validator

The template validator must check:

- Main serial chain has `segment_count` revolute joints or an equivalent terminal-bracket final joint.
- All main joints are revolute.
- Axes match sampled axis family.
- Joint origins align with visible hinge geometry.
- Adjacent segments contact or are within small hinge clearance without broad body overlap.
- Deployed pose moves terminal away from base by a meaningful distance.
- Folded/stowed pose stays coherent and does not collide catastrophically.
- Auxiliary latch/toggle joints, if present, do not count as main chain joints but must remain valid.
- CADQuery mesh assets are ready for CADQuery candidates.

## Reject Cases

Reject outputs that:

- Have fewer than three fold-out moving segments unless a sourced terminal bracket supplies the final fold-out joint.
- Are a generic robotic arm without fold-out/nesting hinge identity.
- Replace complex side plates, slots, rings, latches, or trays with undifferentiated boxes.
- Use prismatic joints for the main chain.
- Place articulation origins away from visible hinges.
- Treat color, material, or size-only changes as candidates.
- Sample aux latch/toggle modules without implementing and testing their joints.
- Use curated or modulo-only seed tables rather than deterministic procedural sampling.
