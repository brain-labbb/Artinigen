"""Failure clustering + diagnosis hints for `articraft template compile-sweep`.

Groups per-seed failures by normalized failure_type and identifies shared
configuration axes across the cluster. Hands each cluster a textual diagnosis
hint that tells the authoring agent where in `_build_*` / `resolve_config` to
look first.

The hint catalog mirrors the spirit of `agent.harness_guidance` (which the
internal record-generation harness injects on known failure patterns) but is
self-contained and CLI-friendly. New failure types can be added to
`DIAGNOSIS_HINTS` without touching the clustering logic.

        "volume because their positions are independently parameterized rather "
        "than derived from a common envelope/rail/axis. Fix: use the parent's "
        "mating face as the datum, then offset child origin OUTWARD along the "

    "fail_if_parts_overlap_in_sampled_poses": (

        "object_model.articulation(). Fix: attach the orphan to its semantic "
        "parent or remove it."
    ),
    "check_mesh_assets_ready": (
        "A visual references a mesh file that does not exist on disk yet. Likely "
        "cause: mesh export path is referenced before the export step runs, or "
        "asset_root/AssetContext is misconfigured. Fix: ensure the mesh-emitting "
        "helper runs before the visual is attached, or hard-code primitive "
